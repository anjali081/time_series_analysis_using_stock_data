# time_series_analysis_using_stock_data
In this project I have used time series analysis for stock market data of Microsoft.I have used the following models for my analysis:
1) LSTM
2) ARIMA
3) XGBoost  
4) GAN
ARIMA models are widely used in time series analysis in Economics.Their simplicity and efficiency makes them handy in Econometrics analysis.LSTMs are relatively new and perform exceptionally well in dealing with problem of long-term dependencies.XGBoost is an ensemble method and is used for supervised learning algorithms which can be used for time series forecasting if data is transformed into supervised learning algorithm.GAN can achieve higher accuracy provided the large dataset and computational power to train them.XGBoost performed well on training data but didnâ€™t perform well on test data.LSTMs and GAN performed well and ARIMA model was the simplest architecture model and performed decently.
